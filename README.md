## Prerequisites

You need to install Zola. My preference is to use `cargo` for this.

```sh
cargo install zola
```

# Building

From the main directory, run:

```sh
zola build
```
# Testing

From the main directory, run:

```sh
zola serve
```

To include draft posts as well:

```sh
zola serve --drafts
```
