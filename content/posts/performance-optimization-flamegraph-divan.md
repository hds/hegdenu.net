Not long ago, I came across a genuine case of code that needed optimising. I was really excited, as it's not every day that you can say this from the outset, and in this particular case, I was pretty sure that there was plenty of room for improvement, but I didn't know where.

![Toot by me. Text: I have an honest to gods #algorithm in need of optimisation. It represents a very large percentage of CPU time per request on over 50% of requests to this one service. I have real input data to use for testing. Iâ€™m going to need to #profile, #benchmark, and run #performance tests across potential optimisations. I am **so** excited! #devLife #optimization.](/img/performance-optimization-flamegraph-divan/toot.png)

## how did I know?

One of our backend services was having trouble with the latency of the requests, up to such a point that it was causing instability. Basically, requests were so slow they caused the pods to timeout and get killed. We'd tracked this down to a specific type of request that required an expensive filtering operation. We knew it was expensive, but until this type of request had increased to over 50% of the requests in a specific region, it hadn't been an issue. Now it was.

As a quick experiment, we tried removing this filtering, and it made a very large difference.

Before going any further, let's make it easier to follow what I'm talking about and actually describe this mysterious filtering.

## aside: corridor filter

To set the scene, our context is filtering geographical points (points on a map). A corridor filter is a polyline with a radius. What does that mean?

A polyline is literally multiple lines, stuck together. In our case, we'll set the requirement that each point connects to two others (although overlapping and closing the polyline are allowed). Here's an example.

![Five dots connected in a series by four line segments to form a polyline.](/img/performance-optimization-flamegraph-divan/corridor-1-polyline.png)

The radius means that we consider all the space that is `r` meters (because we're sensible and we use the metric system) from any part of the polyline. Visually, this can be shown as circles of radius `r` around each point and rotated rectangles centered on each line segment. This visualization can be seen in the image below. The corridor is all the area covered by the blue shapes.

![Same polyline as the previous image, the radius is shown visually as circles and rectangles in blue around the polyline.](/img/performance-optimization-flamegraph-divan/corridor-2-polyline-with-radius.png)

The radius `r` has been marked on the left most circle and rectangle.

That's our corridor. The corridor filter is a function that takes a corridor (polyline and a radius) and a set of points and returns only the points that are inside the corridor. Let's add some points in the same space as the corridor.

![The polyline with radius shown with various points plotted around it. The points which fall inside the corridor are red, the points that fall outside are green.](/img/performance-optimization-flamegraph-divan/corridor-3-points-in-out-corridor.png)

The points which fall inside the corridor are colored red, those that fall outside the corridor are colored green. The filter for this corridor would return only the red points.

It is not only for illustration that the points are all close to the corridor. In the service, we select the points to filter for out of an index. The points that we preselect are those in a bounding box around the corridor itself. A bounding box is a straight (not rotated) rectangle drawn around some group of objects, in our case the corridor.

![The corridor is shown (without the filtered points) with a purple rectangle drawn around it such that the edges of the rectangle and the corridor touch.](/img/performance-optimization-flamegraph-divan/corridor-4-corridor-with-bounding-box.png)

Notice how the bounding box can't be any smaller and still contain the corridor within it.

Now that we understand what a corridor filter is, let's go back to the experiment.

## removing the filtering

As you can see from the image of the corridor with points inside and outside it, the corridor filter is a refinement step. We start with a set of points which are close to the corridor (within the bounding box) and then check which ones are inside the corridor.

As an experiment, we switched out a corridor request coming to the API for the bounding box around the corridor. This would mean that we have to serialize additional data, but the corridor filtering wouldn't be needed. We used this test to validate our assumption that the corridor test was the most expensive part of handling requests.

Using a set of requests previously seen in our worst performing region, a performance test was run, scaling up the number of requests. An initial test was run with the corridor filtering active, and then the second test was run with just the bounding boxes - all using the same request pool.

The results are quite clear when visualizing the response times (average, p95, p98, and p99). p99 response time means the 99th percentile of response times for some window - if you order all requests by response time and remove the slowest 1% of requests, the p99 response time is the slowest time that is left.

![A time series graph showing average, p95, p98, and p99 response times. There are two separate sets of lines (executed at different times, with a gap in the middle), the ones on the left are labelled "Corridor filtering" adn the ones on the right are labelled "Only bounding box".](/img/performance-optimization-flamegraph-divan/latency_without_filtering.png)

So by removing the filtering, we reduced even the p99 time below 200 milliseconds, whereas both the p98 and the p99 had grown to over 2 seconds in the previous test. Clearly, the filtering was the most expensive part of serving requests. This sort of performance test can be really valuable to test assumptions on real workloads. We have an internally developed tool for this at work, but there are plenty of alternatives available.

We can't just take the filtering out though, our end users expect the results returned to be only those within the corridor, not the ones in a bounding box around the corridor.

We've definitely got an algorithm that needs optimizing. The next question is whether it can be optimized, and for that we need to look at where it's spending time. Let's see how to do that.

## flame graphs

Flame Graphs are a visual analysis tool for hierarchical data. As far as I can tell, they were created by [Brendan Gregg](https://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html), and it is certainly his writing on flame graphs and his tool to convert profiling data into interactive SVG flame graphs that has made them popular.

Flame graphs are most commonly used to visualize CPU profiling data (although they're used for all sorts of other measures as well). Where the call stack forms the flames and the width of each section indicates how many samples were recorded in that particular call stack. A flame graph groups all the matching call stacks together, so there is no notion of the series of execution - if you want that, you need a [flame chart](https://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html#variant) instead.

Let's illustrate what we expect to see from a flame graph. Here's some simple Rust code:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Some work here in main first
    cheap_thing();
    expensive_thing();
}

fn cheap_thing() {
    // Do some light computation here
}

fn expensive_thing() {
    for _ in 0..10_000 {
        expensive_inner();
        more_expensive_inner();
    }
}

fn expensive_inner() {
    // Do some heavy computation here
}

fn more_expensive_inner() {
    // Do some **really** heavy computation here
}
```

A flame graph for this code might look something like the following.

![A flame graph consisting of 3 levels. The bottom level is occupied by a single box labelled `main`. The second level has a small gap on the left followed by a box occupying roughly 20% of the width labelled `cheap_thing` and another occupying the rest of the width to the right side labelled `expensive_thing`. The third level only has boxes on top of `expensive_thing`, 40% covered by `expensive_inner` and the remaining 60% covered by `more_expensive_inner`.](/img/performance-optimization-flamegraph-divan/flame_graph-1.png)

Since the entire execution starts from `main()`, the bottom level of the flame graph is a single box. The second layer represents functions called from `main()`. We have a small gap for samples which were taken within main itself corresponding to the comment `// Some work here in main first`, the rest is covered by a narrower box labelled `cheap_thing` and a wider box labelled `expensive_thing`. The wider box indicates more samples were taken there, which corresponds (probabilistically) to the CPU spending more time there. From this flame graph, we see that no samples were recorded in any function called from `cheap_thing`, but that samples were recorded in the 2 functions called from `expensive_thing`. Once again, the widths indicate execution time spent in each one.

Of course, real flame charts aren't usually so neat. Amongst other things, `main()` is actually a series of std library calls.

If we were optimizing this code, we can see that we probably want to start with `expensive_thing` and the 2 functions it calls.

## flamegraphs in rust

When I first used flame graphs it was from C++. This usually involved a multistep process where you have to set up a specific (release like) build, profile it with [`perf`](https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page), and then convert it to a flame graph SVG with Brendan Gregg's [`flamegraph.pl`](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph/blob/master/flamegraph.pl) (yes, a Perl script).

If you're using Rust, it's much easier these days, you can use the [`cargo flamegraph`](https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph) command which does all of that for you! The GitHub README also has a good introduction to using flame graphs for system performance work. Now let's install the cargo command.

```sh
cargo install flamegraph
```

It's important to note that you **don't** want to install `cargo-flamegraph` which is an old, unmaintained project which does the same thing, but not as complete.

Once it's done, we can run it like any other cargo command.

```sh
cargo flamegraph
```

This will generate a flame graph SVG in your current directory

There are plenty of options to modify the sample rate and choose the target you wish to profile. In my case, I had some trouble selecting a unit test from a binary crate and so I ended up moving the code into a separate crate just for the purpose of optimizing it, I then ported the code back. This isn't ideal, but you sometimes end up doing this anyway so that benchmarks can be run on new and old code at the same time (more on that later!).

## profiling the corridor filter

Computers are really fast. And even sampling almost 1000 times a second (`cargo flamegraph` defaults to 997 Hz), we may not get the best picture of where the CPU is spending its time. The easy answer to this is to do it lots of times. We set up our corridor and the points we want to test against, and then execute the filter in a loop. This will give us a more statistically accurate result.

Let's have a look at the result. It's an SVG, so you can render it in a web-site directly (like I'm doing below), but if you open just the SVG in your browser, it's interactive! You can click on boxes in the flame graph to zoom to it and make it occupy the full horizontal width. Try it for yourself by clicking on the image below to open the SVG.

[![A flame graph of the execution. There aren't a lot of details, it appears that most of the time is spent main, with a reasonable part of that time calling from main directly into sin, cos, and asin functions.](/img/performance-optimization-flamegraph-divan/flamegraph-medium_corridor_baseline-inlined.svg)](/img/performance-optimization-flamegraph-divan/flamegraph-medium_corridor_baseline-inlined.svg)

Here we can see that most of the time is spent in `main`, which is expected. There's a high callstack on the right that takes up some time, if you check the interactive flame graph, you'll see that it's `serde` related. That's the set up process where we're loading the corridor and points from a JSON file, we can ignore that bit as it's not part of our actual corridor filter implementation.

But then it gets weird. From main it looks like we're calling directly into `sin`, `cos`, and `asin` functions from `libsystem_m.dylib` (I'm on macOS). We are definitely using these functions (welcome to geocoordinates), but we're not calling them from `main`. We also see calls to some of these trigonometric functions from outside of `main`. What's going on?

Inlining! The call stack depends on how our functions have been optimized by the compiler. Because we profile in release mode (with debug symbols), we see optimizations taking place, one of which is inlining.

Inlining is when the compiler takes the contents of a function and rather than keeping it separate and calling into it, inserts it wherever that function is called. For small functions, this often brings a reasonable performance improvement, but it does make performance analysis harder.

In Rust, you can assert some control over this process with the [`#[inline]` attribute](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/attributes/codegen.html#the-inline-attribute). In our case, we want to suggest to the compiler that we would prefer if certain functions were not inlined. For that we do the following:

```rust
#[inline(never)]
fn distance_to_segment_m(point: &Point, segment: &[Point; 2]) -> f64 {
    // Function body
}
```

Let's sprinkle a few of these around and try again. This may make our code slower, but we should still be able to get a better idea of where the time is spent.

[![A flame graph of the execution. We now see more functions in between main and the trigonometric functions.](/img/performance-optimization-flamegraph-divan/flamegraph-medium_corridor_baseline.svg)](/img/performance-optimization-flamegraph-divan/flamegraph-medium_corridor_baseline.svg)

That's much better, we can now see more of the call stack. Knowing the code, it still looks a bit odd to me, there are call stacks which seem to be missing intermediate functions. I don't know why this is, but it does seem to happen - performance profiling can be as much an art as a science at times.

So let's look at what we can tell from the flame graph. Looking from the top, we see that 77% of the total execution time was spent inside `distance_meters`. This is not what I was expecting. That function "just" implements the [Haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) to calculate the distance between two points. The function does use the trigonometric functions which show up in the flame graph - it seems they are more expensive than we'd thought.

You can see that domain knowledge is important when analyzing the performance of your code (or anyone else's). Often, the biggest challenge is interpreting the results of the performance profiling within the domain you're working in. We'll see this again as we try to optimise this code.

## optimizing the corridor filter

We've found out that measuring the distance between two points is the most expensive part of our filter. This wasn't entirely clear from the outset, as when measuring the distance from a point to a line segment, we first need to determine the point on the line segment which is closest to our point.

My gut feeling had been that this is where the performance bottleneck would be - however from our flame graph, we can see that `distance_to_segment_m` only accounted for 10% of the samples. Take this as a lesson, [humans are bad at guessing about performance](https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph/tree/v0.6.5?tab=readme-ov-file#humans-are-terrible-at-guessing-about-performance).

So, what can we do to improve the filter code. When filtering, we have to compare every point (let's say we have `N`) to all of the line segments in the corridor's polyline (let's say we have `M`), so we have `NM` distance calculations. Let's try and reduce that, or at least replace it with something cheaper.

Something cheaper than a distance calculation is a bounding box check. Checking whether or not a point is in a bounding box requires 4 comparison operations, which is much cheaper than the Haversine formula. Or at least we think it is.

As mentioned, for each segment of the corridor, we need to calculate the distance to every point. Let's take the second segment of our corridor and visualize this with the points we used previously.

![The polyline for our corridor is shown, but the blue regions representing the radius are only shown for the second segment from the left. The points to filter are shown, only a single point falls within the segment corridor.](/img/performance-optimization-flamegraph-divan/corridor-5-segment_corridor_points.png)

We can see that out of the total 8 points, only a single one falls within the corridor for the selected segment. But to determine this, we need to perform 8 distance calculations.

Instead, let's draw a bounding box around the corridor segment. Calculating the bounding box for that segment is likely not much more expensive than a distance calculation, but once done we can use it for all points. Let's visualize what this would look like.

![The polyline for our corridor is shown, but the blue regions representing the radius are only shown for the second segment from the left. A purple bounding box is shown around the segment corridor. The points to filter are shown, now there are 3 points that fall within the segment bounding box.](/img/performance-optimization-flamegraph-divan/corridor-6-segment_bounding_box_points.png)

Now we see that 3 points fall inside the bounding box, the single point that is in the segment corridor as well as 2 more which aren't. This is a pre-filter, we still need to calculate the distance from these 3 points to the segment, but for the remaining 5 points which are outside the bounding box, that calculation can be skipped.

Of course, this is all very nice in theory, but before we start running our full service performance tests, it would be nice to see how our bounding box pre-filter performs compared to the baseline corridor filter. For this we're going to run some benchmarks!

## benchmarking with divan

While optimizing our corridor filter we said _"calculating the bounding box for that segment is likely not much more expensive than a distance calculation"_. It's OK to implement something based on your understanding of how expensive the computation is, but afterwards it's best to go back and validate that understanding - you'll often be surprised!

Now that we have our optimized corridor filter, we're going to compare it with the baseline. For this, I'm going to use [Divan](https://github.com/nvzqz/divan). [Criterion](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs) is probably the go-to benchmarking library for Rust, but I wanted to try Divan because I'd heard about it from the creator, [Nikolai Vazquez](https://nikolaivazquez.com/), at [RustLab](https://rustlab.it/past-editions/2023) last year. I won't go into comparing the two options, because I have never used Criterion.

The set up is pretty straight forward and is described in this [blog post](https://nikolaivazquez.com/blog/divan/). Create a file in the `benches` directory of your crate with a very small amount of boilerplate.

```rust
fn main() {
    divan::main();
}

#[divan::bench]
fn some_benchmark() {
    // do things here
}
```

One thing that I completely missed when I started using Divan is that you also need to update your `Cargo.toml` to include the bench.

```toml
[[bench]]
name = "benchmark"
harness = false
```

This is apparently also true for Criterion, and it's because the value for `harness` is `true` by default, but actually using Cargo's own bench support [requires nightly](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-bench.html).

To get a reasonable spread of benchmark results, we set up 4 scenarios. We have corridors of different numbers of points and varying numbers of "locations", each location is made up of various points. For each scenario we consider the number of locations to be filtered and the total number that fall within the corridor.
- `small_corridor`: 4 point corridor, 13/15 locations match
- `medium_corridor`: 109 point corridor, 70/221 locations match
- `long_narrow_corridor_few_total`: 300 point corridor, 34/65 locations match
- `long_corridor_many_filtered`: 251 point corridor, 251/2547 locations match

I like the way that Divan allows you to organize benchmarks in modules. So for the first scenario, the benchmark file would be organized in the following manner.

```rust
mod small_corridor {
    use super::*;

    #[divan::bench]
    fn baseline(bencher: divan::Bencher) {
        // bench code
    }

    #[divan::bench]
    fn pre_bbox(bencher: divan::Bencher) {
        // bench code
    }
}
```

And then we'd do the same for the other 3 scenarios. These can all be added to the same bench file, with a single `main` function.

The scenarios with longer corridors take a reasonable amount of time to execute, so the default 100 iterations that Divan uses would take too long. Those were reduced to 10 and 20 iterations respectively. Now, let's look at the results (using release profile of course)!

```

The results were better than we had expected. As you can see, we saw a 100x speed up in all cases except the small corridor, but even in that scenario there was a 5x to 8x speed up. Our optimization made the worst case scenarios significantly better and even gave a reasonable improvement in the smallest scenario where optimizations attempts could potentially lead to worse performance. And we know all this because of the benchmarking, instead of just guessing!

Now that we have some confidence in our changes, let's compare them in the same performance tests that we used at the beginning. Note that "old" and "new" have switched sides compared to the first latency graph that I showed.

![A time series graph showing average, p95, p98, and p99 response times. There are two separate sets of lines (executed at different times, with a gap in the middle), the ones on the left are labelled "Pre-filtering with bounding box" and the ones on the right are labelled "Old corridor filtering".](/img/performance-optimization-flamegraph-divan/latency_baseline_vs_pre_bbox.png)

Again, the results are impressive. The same performance test turned huge latency peaks into what looks like a flat line. Now we're good to go to production with confidence (and the right monitoring strategy).

## so it went to production, right?

Well..., no. Or, kind of.

I've skipped over some details that had nothing to do with the performance optimization. Let's fill them in.

This service is made up of two parts, a frontend service (Rust) which deals with HTTP requests from end users and then forwards the request onto a back-end service (C++) which contains the indexed data.

The corridor filtering is done on the backend service, but the front-end service scales much faster (and is cheaper), so it made sense to consider moving this expensive filtering function to the front-end service. Because the filtering was so expensive, it was cheaper for the back-end service to serialize additional elements that were going to be filtered out, rather than doing the filtering there. And that was true, until we optimized the filtering code and saw how much faster it was. At that point we ported the changes back to the original C++ code and left the filtering where it was.

After bringing the optimizations to the filtering code in the back-end service, it became less expensive to filter there than to serialize the additional elements which would be filtered out. In the end the results were good. Latency is down and so are costs, so it's win-win.

## final words

If I was reading this post without any prior knowledge, I think I'd feel a little disappointed. It all seemed like a lot of extra work for something that turned out to be easy. After all, our first optimization attempt resulted in a 100x speed up and then we stopped there.

However, my experience is that this is often the case. The trick here was a combination of profiling and domain knowledge driven intuition. My initial assumption about where to optimize was incorrect, but I never tried implementing that because the profiling results pointed me in another direction.

But once I had the direction, I could apply my own domain experience to the problem and guess at a solution. The benchmarking quickly showed me that the first guess did provide a reduction in execution time. In this write up I skipped the bit where we started benchmarking before we had all the functional test cases passing - because if it wasn't faster, we weren't going to bother fixing edge cases.

As I said earlier, performance optimization is sometimes as much an art as a science, but you need both parts to be effective.
