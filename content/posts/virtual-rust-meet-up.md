Today we had the first [Rust for Lunch](https://lunch.rs/meetups/2023-10-31/) meet-up.

It was ...

(insert result here)

As a bit of a post-mortem, I thought I'd write up the process.

We'll start with the obvious question.

Why create some new Rust meet-up?

## why a new meet-up?

I like meet-ups.

Or rather, I like the idea of meet-ups.

Get together with a group of like-minded people.

Hear interesting ideas on your common topic of interest.

Ask questions directly.

Socialise, meet new people, enjoy yourself.

But I've always found it hard to fit them into my schedule.

Bad enough when I lived in Berlin and could often walk there.

(pre-pandemic when we met in person without thinking about it)

Now I live in a small city.

I don't know many people here outside family.

And family makes attending a meet-up more complicated.

Especially in evenings and when they last 2.5 hours.

(and that goes for virtual meet-ups too)

What I wanted was a meet-up that **fits in a lunch break**.

Unfortunately, such a thing didn't exist.

So I had to create it.

## does anyone else want this?

I had a little experience with the format.

At work we have a "Rustacean Meet" every 4 weeks.

It's a work thing, but otherwise very similar.

A one hour slot.

One talk with questions afterwards.

(or two short talks)

We typically have 15-20 people join.

Which is probably half the people who work with Rust in the company.

So that's a good sign.

I also asked some people on Discord.

And got some interest not just in attending, but also in speaking at such a meet-up.

That was enough to take the first step in any serious project.

## finding the first speaker

This was the easiest bit.

[Conrad](https://github.com/conradludgate) had shown interest more than once.

He also seemed to just have a topic ready.

So that was easy.

I hope finding the second speaker will be just as easy.

## software

I went looking for advice on what software to use.

Amongst the people I asked, Google Meet seemed very popular.

I started digging in a bit more.

Then I got a reply on Mastodon that made me think.

[![@hds I would love to attend, but please don't use a proprietary platform :blobcatcry: What about Jitsi?](/img/virtual-rust-meet-up/mo8it@fosstodon.org-111257345962838174.png)](https://hachyderm.io/deck/@mo8it@fosstodon.org/111257345962838174)

Yes, the fact that I'm active on Mastodon and not Twitter comes into play here.

(sorry, not ~~Twitter~~, X)

Which also made me think whether I want to record these sessions.

At work we record them.

But we're at work anyway.

A poll indicated that some people would be less likely to join if the meet-up was recorded.

And in the meantime, I'd been given another suggestion for software.
